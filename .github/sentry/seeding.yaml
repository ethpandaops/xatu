# Sentry smoke test configuration
#
# This config defines which event types to test in the sentry smoke test.
# The test connects to a live beacon node and subscribes to real-time events.
#
# Only event types that fire frequently enough for CI assertions are included.
# Events like finalized_checkpoint (~13 min interval) are subscribed to but
# not gated on, since they're too slow for a smoke test.
#
# The assertions verify that data flows through the entire pipeline:
# Beacon Node -> Sentry -> Xatu Server -> Kafka -> Vector -> ClickHouse
