# CMD Component Rules

CLI command entry points that bootstrap all Xatu components via cobra CLI framework.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use cobra.Command for consistent CLI interface across all components
- Implement config override pattern for environment variables and CLI flags
- Initialize each component with standardized config loading, logging setup, and graceful shutdown

## Important Constraints  
- All commands must support YAML config files with sensible defaults
- Environment variables and CLI flags override config file values
- Maintain consistent logging initialization pattern across all component commands
