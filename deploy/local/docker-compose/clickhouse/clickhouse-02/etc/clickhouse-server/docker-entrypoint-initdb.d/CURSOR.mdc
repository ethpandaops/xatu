# ClickHouse-02 Database Initialization

ClickHouse database initialization script for the second node in a distributed cluster setup.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Configures distributed ClickHouse cluster with clickhouse-01 as primary shard
- Uses ReplicatedMergeTree engine for data replication across cluster nodes
- Implements schema migration tracking with distributed tables

## Important Constraints
- Must coordinate with clickhouse-01 instance for cluster configuration
- Requires CLICKHOUSE_USER, CLICKHOUSE_PASSWORD, and CLICKHOUSE_USER_READONLY_PASSWORD environment variables
- Uses specific cluster name 'cluster_2S_1R' (2 Shards, 1 Replica) for distributed operations
- Schema migration table must be created before Xatu server can track database changes
