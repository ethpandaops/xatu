# Docs Component Rules

Component documentation providing user guides for Xatu's monitoring clients and centralized server.

## Primary Purpose
Provides comprehensive user documentation for all Xatu components including configuration, deployment, and usage instructions.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Component-Specific Guides**: Each client (cannon, sentry, discovery, mimicry) and server has dedicated documentation
- **Configuration-Driven**: All components use YAML configuration with extensive parameter documentation
- **Modular Architecture**: Documents how components can run independently or as part of larger monitoring setup

## Important Constraints
- Keep documentation synchronized with actual configuration options and code changes
- Maintain consistent structure across all component documentation files
- Include practical examples and usage patterns for each component
