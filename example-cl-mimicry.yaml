# sharding:
#   # Topic-based sharding configuration
#   # Each topic pattern maps to a specific set of active shards
#   # The sharder automatically determines the appropriate sharding key (MsgID, Topic, etc.) based on the event type
#   # Note: totalShards can be configured independently for each topic pattern (e.g., 512, 1024, 256, etc.)
#   #
#   # Event-Type-Aware Patterns:
#   # You can prefix patterns with specific event types to apply different sampling rates
#   # Format: "EVENT_TYPE:topic_pattern" or just "topic_pattern" for all events
#   # Wildcards supported: "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_*:pattern" matches all RPC_META events
#   topics:
#     # Event-specific patterns (new feature)
#     # 100% sampling for direct gossipsub attestations
#     "LIBP2P_TRACE_GOSSIPSUB_BEACON_ATTESTATION:.*beacon_attestation.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-511"] # 100% sampling for gossipsub events
#
#     # 5% sampling for RPC meta events on attestation topics
#     "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_*:.*beacon_attestation.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-25"] # ~5% sampling for control messages
#
#     # Legacy patterns (still supported)
#     # High priority: 100% sampling for beacon blocks
#     ".*beacon_block.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-511"] # 100% sampling (all shards active)
#
#     # Medium priority: 50% sampling for attestations (default for other event types)
#     ".*beacon_attestation.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-255"] # 50% sampling (256/512 shards)
#
#     # Low priority: 12.5% sampling for sync committee
#     ".*sync_committee.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-63"] # 12.5% sampling (64/512 shards)
#
#     # Very low priority: ~0.2% sampling for blob sidecars
#     ".*blob_sidecar.*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: [0] # 1/512 sampling (~0.2%)
#
#     # Very low priority: ~0.2% sampling for data column sidecars

#     ".*":
#       totalShards: 512
#       activeShards: ["0-31"] # ~6.25% sampling (32/512 shards)
#
#     # Example: Using different totalShards for specific use cases
#     # You could use 1024 shards for finer-grained control
#     ".*special_topic.*":
#       totalShards: 1024
#       activeShards: ["0-127"] # 12.5% sampling (128/1024 shards)
#
#     # Example: Mix of ranges and individual shards

#   # Configuration for events without sharding keys (Group D events)
#   noShardingKeyEvents:
#     enabled: true # Process all events without sharding keys
#
# randomSampling:
#   # Random sampling configuration - provides a "second chance" for events
#   # that were NOT captured by deterministic sharding.
#   #
#   # Pattern Format:
#   # - For GroupC events (IWANT, IDONTWANT - no topic): Use exact event type
#   #   e.g., "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_CONTROL_IWANT"
#   # - For GroupA/B events (with topic): Use "EVENT_TYPE*:topic_pattern"
#   #   e.g., "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_CONTROL_IHAVE*:.*attestation.*"
#   # - For topic-only patterns: Use regex pattern
#   #   e.g., ".*beacon_block.*"
#   #
#   # Note: Random sampling only applies to events REJECTED by deterministic
#   # sharding. Events already accepted are NOT sampled again (no duplicates).
#   patterns:
#     # 2% random sample of IWANT events
#     "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_CONTROL_IWANT":
#       chance: "2%"
#
#     # 2% random sample of IHAVE attestation events
#     "LIBP2P_TRACE_RPC_META_CONTROL_IHAVE*:.*attestation.*":
#       chance: "2%"
#
#     # 0.5% catch-all for any other rejected events
#     ".*":
#       chance: "0.5%"
