# Blockprint Client

Go client for the Blockprint API service that classifies Ethereum consensus client implementations based on block fingerprinting.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **HTTP Client Wrapper**: Encapsulates REST API interactions with configurable headers and endpoint
- **Typed Response Models**: Provides structured response types for client probability maps and block data
- **Context-Aware Requests**: All API calls accept context for cancellation and timeout control

## Important Implementation Details
- Use `Client.get()` method for all HTTP requests - handles BOM removal and JSON unmarshaling
- Probability maps provide safe accessor methods for each known client type (Prysm, Lighthouse, etc.)
- API responses use snake_case field names - respect existing `json` tags exactly as defined
