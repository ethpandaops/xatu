# Coordinator Component

gRPC client for coordinating distributed cannon data collection operations.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **gRPC Client Design**: Simple wrapper around xatu.CoordinatorClient protocol buffers interface
- **Location Management**: Handles cannon location retrieval and upsert operations for distributed coordination
- **Header Authentication**: Supports custom headers for authentication and metadata passing

## Important Constraints
- Minimal stateless client - no complex state management or caching
- Always use gzip compression for gRPC calls to optimize network usage
- TLS configuration must match coordinator server requirements
