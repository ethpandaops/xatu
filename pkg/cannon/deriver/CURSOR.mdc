# Deriver Component

Event derivation system that extracts structured data from beacon blocks using pluggable deriver implementations.

## Core Architecture Pattern
- **EventDeriver Interface**: All derivers implement unified interface with Start/Stop lifecycle, Name/CannonType identification, and ActivationFork fork requirements
- **Versioned API Structure**: Organize derivers by Beacon API version (v1/, v2/) to handle breaking changes in upstream specifications
- **Callback-Based Event Emission**: Use OnEventsDerived callbacks for loose coupling between derivation and output handling

## Implementation Requirements
- Implement EventDeriver interface for all new derivers with proper ActivationFork specification
- Register new derivers in compile-time interface validation (var _ EventDeriver = statements)
- Place derivers in appropriate version directory based on Beacon API compatibility
- Follow fork-aware activation pattern - derivers must declare minimum required fork version
