# Beacon API ETH V1 Derivers

Finalized beacon chain data extractors that collect structured data via Ethereum Beacon API v1 endpoints.

## Core Implementation Pattern
- **Iterator-Driven Processing**: All derivers use BackfillingCheckpoint iterators for systematic epoch-by-epoch data collection
- **Fork-Aware Activation**: Each deriver specifies ActivationFork (Phase0, Deneb) to handle network upgrade compatibility
- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Use 3-minute max interval backoff for resilience against temporary beacon node issues

## Key Design Requirements
- Process epochs sequentially via iterator.Next() for data completeness
- Check beacon.Synced() before processing to avoid stale data
- Implement proper fork activation (Phase0 for most, Deneb for blob sidecars)
- Use callback-based event emission via OnEventsDerived for output handling
