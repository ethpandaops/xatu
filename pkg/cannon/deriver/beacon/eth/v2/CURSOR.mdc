# ETH v2 Beacon API Derivers

ETH v2 Beacon API data derivers that extract specific beacon chain events from finalized blockchain data.

## Key Implementation Pattern
- **Uniform Deriver Structure**: All v2 derivers follow identical pattern with backfilling checkpoint iterator and event callbacks
- **Multi-version Ethereum Spec Support**: Handle version-specific data extraction (Phase0, Bellatrix, Capella, Deneb, Electra)
- **Exponential Backoff Retry**: Use consistent retry logic with 3-minute max interval for robustness

## Critical Requirements  
- All derivers extract events from beacon blocks during slot processing within epoch iteration
- Use snappy compression for transaction data and SSZ marshaling for block data
- Always set FinalizedWhenRequested=true for cannon-derived events
- Include comprehensive additional metadata (slot, epoch, block root, transaction counts/sizes)
