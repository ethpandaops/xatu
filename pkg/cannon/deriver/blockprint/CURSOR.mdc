# Blockprint Deriver

Ethereum client identification deriver that uses machine learning to classify consensus client types from beacon blocks.

## Implementation Pattern
- **External Service Integration**: Fetches classification data from Blockprint API rather than local analysis
- **Batch Processing**: Configurable batch size for efficient API calls with built-in retry logic and backoff
- **Probability Mapping**: Converts ML confidence scores into structured client probability data (Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, etc.)

## Critical Requirements
- Must handle API rate limiting with exponential backoff and configurable batch sizes
- Always include retry logic for external service failures
- Map all supported client types in probability responses (Prysm, Lighthouse, Nimbus, Lodestar, Teku, Grandine, Uncertain)
