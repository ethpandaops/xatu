# Ethereum Package

Beacon API client wrapper that provides caching, preloading, and service management for Cannon's finalized data collection.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service Interface**: All components implement `services.Service` interface with lifecycle management
- **Caching Layer**: Uses TTL caches for blocks and validators with singleflight deduplication
- **Preloading System**: Background workers preload frequently accessed data to reduce API latency
- **Beacon API Abstraction**: Wraps `go-eth2-client` with operational enhancements for production workloads

## Critical Constraints
- Maintain cache consistency during network upgrades and reorgs
- Handle beacon node connection failures gracefully with retry logic
- Coordinate preloading to avoid overwhelming beacon node API rate limits
