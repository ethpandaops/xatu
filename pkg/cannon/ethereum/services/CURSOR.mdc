# Services Package

Core service interfaces and implementations that provide beacon client abstraction, duties management, and metadata services for Cannon's finalized data collection.

## Key Implementation Patterns
- **Service Interface**: All services implement `Service` interface with Start/Stop/Ready lifecycle and OnReady callbacks
- **Retry with Backoff**: Services use exponential backoff for beacon API operations with context-aware error handling
- **TTL Caching**: Beacon committees and metadata cached with 90-minute TTL to reduce API load
- **Event Subscriptions**: Services support callback registration for data availability notifications

## Critical Constraints
- Services must be ready before allowing data collection - check Ready() status
- Mutex protection required for concurrent access to cached data and subscription lists
- Always include retry logic with exponential backoff for beacon node interactions
