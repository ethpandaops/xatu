# Iterator Component

Provides epoch and slot iteration patterns for systematic cannon data collection with backfilling and checkpoint coordination.

## Key Patterns
- **BackfillingCheckpoint Iterator**: Coordinates bidirectional data collection (head + backfill) using checkpoint-based progress tracking
- **Coordinator Integration**: All iterators maintain state via coordinator client for distributed collection consistency

## Implementation Guidelines  
- Implement observability tracing for all iterator Next() operations
- Use phase0.Epoch/phase0.Slot types for time-based operations
- Handle fork activation constraints - iterators must respect cannon type activation forks
- Always include look-ahead epoch calculation for efficient batch processing
