# CL-Mimicry Component Rules

Consensus layer P2P network monitoring client that mimics validator behavior to collect libp2p and gossipsub events from Ethereum consensus networks.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Event-driven architecture**: Processes Hermes events and routes them through configured output sinks
- **Dual client integration**: Combines Hermes libp2p node with Ethereum beacon client for comprehensive monitoring
- **Prysm compatibility**: Relies on Prysm beacon client for consensus layer operations and network participation

## Critical Constraints
- **Network configuration consistency**: config.ethereum.network and prysm network settings must align to prevent fork digest mismatches
- **Hermes event categorization**: Events are strictly categorized into GossipSub, libp2p protocol, libp2p core, and RPC types
- **Trace sampling**: Uses configurable shard-based sampling for high-volume event filtering
