# Ethereum Beacon Node Component

Beacon node abstraction that manages services and provides sync status validation for consensus layer monitoring.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service lifecycle management**: BeaconNode orchestrates metadata and duties services with readiness callbacks
- **Sync status validation**: Validates both beacon node sync distance and service readiness before operations
- **Network configuration integration**: Supports standard networks and devnet configurations via beacon package

## Critical Constraints
- **Service dependency ordering**: Services must be started sequentially and marked ready before the node is considered operational
- **Sync distance threshold**: Node must be within 3 blocks of network head and less than 32 slots behind current slot
- **Service interface compliance**: All services must implement the Service interface with lifecycle methods
