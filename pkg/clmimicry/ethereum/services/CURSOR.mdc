# Services Component

Service interface abstractions and implementations for beacon node duty management and metadata collection.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service lifecycle contract**: All services implement Start/Stop/Ready/OnReady pattern for orchestrated initialization
- **TTL-cached duty fetching**: DutiesService maintains 60-minute cached beacon committees and proposer duties with proactive refresh
- **Event-driven sync monitoring**: Services respond to chain reorgs, sync status changes, and epoch transitions for cache invalidation

## Critical Constraints
- **Readiness dependency chain**: Services must mark Ready() only when all required epochs are cached and accessible
- **Cache invalidation triggers**: Chain reorgs and sync status changes force immediate refetch of required epoch duties
- **Epoch timing coordination**: Duties fetched anticipatively before epoch transitions with precise sleep timing
