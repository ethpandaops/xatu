# Discovery Cache Component

TTL-based caching system for duplicate detection in node discovery operations.

## Key Architecture Pattern
- **TTL-Based Deduplication**: Uses `ttlcache` with 120-minute TTL to prevent duplicate node processing
- **Integrated Metrics**: Prometheus gauges track cache performance (hits, misses, insertions, evictions)
- **Scheduled Updates**: Background cron job updates metrics every 5 seconds for real-time monitoring

## Critical Design Decisions
- Cache stores timestamps keyed by node identifiers for duplicate detection
- Metrics are automatically registered with Prometheus on cache creation
- Start/Stop lifecycle management integrates with parent discovery component
