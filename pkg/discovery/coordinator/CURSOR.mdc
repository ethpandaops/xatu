# Discovery Coordinator Client

gRPC client that sends discovered node records and execution client status to the centralized Xatu coordinator server.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Batch Processing**: Uses `processor.BatchItemProcessor` for efficient bulk uploads of node records
- **Dual gRPC Clients**: Maintains separate connections for node record exports and status reporting
- **Status Monitoring**: Fetches stale node records from coordinator and reports execution client status updates
- **Header Authentication**: Supports custom gRPC headers for coordinator authentication

## Important Constraints
- All node records are batched and sent asynchronously via the processor pipeline
- Status updates for execution clients are sent immediately via synchronous gRPC calls
- Both TLS and insecure connections supported based on configuration
- Connection failures require graceful shutdown of the batch processor
