# P2P Status Component

Ethereum execution node status checker that dials discovered nodes to verify connectivity and gather protocol information.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Factory Pattern**: Uses `NewP2P()` factory with type-based instantiation for pluggable implementations (static, xatu)
- **Event-Driven Status**: Publishes execution node status via emission broker for async consumption
- **Concurrent Dialing**: Manages multiple simultaneous peer connections with retry logic and 15-second timeouts
- **Mimicry Integration**: Leverages `ethcore/mimicry` client for execution layer handshakes and status retrieval

## Critical Design Decisions
- Always use retry logic with 5 attempts and 5-second delays for peer connections
- Maintain thread-safe active connection counting with mutex protection
- Status checks must complete within 15 seconds or timeout automatically
- All peer connections are ephemeral - establish, gather status, then disconnect immediately
