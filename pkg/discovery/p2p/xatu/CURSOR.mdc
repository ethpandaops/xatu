# Xatu Coordinator

gRPC client that fetches dynamic boot nodes from Xatu server for DiscV4/V5 discovery protocols.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Scheduled Updates**: Uses gocron to periodically fetch fresh boot nodes from server every restart interval
- **Dual Protocol**: Simultaneously updates both DiscV4 and DiscV5 with same boot nodes from coordinator
- **TLS Configuration**: Supports both secure and insecure gRPC connections based on config

## Critical Constraints
- Must always use gzip compression for coordinator requests to reduce bandwidth
- Boot node updates are synchronous - both protocols must be restarted with new nodes
- Error handling must not interrupt the scheduling loop - log errors but continue operation
