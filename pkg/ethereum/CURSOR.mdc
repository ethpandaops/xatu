# Ethereum Client Types

Provides standardized Ethereum consensus client type definitions and string-based client detection utilities.

## Key Patterns
- Use `Client` type for all client representations instead of raw strings
- Detection logic supports fuzzy matching via `strings.Contains` for flexible client identification
- Always return `ClientUnknown` for unrecognized client strings rather than errors
- Maintain the `AllClients` slice when adding new client types for enumeration
