# Mimicry Component

Execution layer P2P network monitoring client that collects data from Ethereum execution layer peers.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Coordinator-based architecture**: Uses pluggable coordinator types (static, xatu) to manage peer connections and data collection
- **Event-driven processing**: Processes decorated events through multiple configurable output sinks 
- **Capture delay mechanism**: Implements configurable delay before capturing transactions from peers to ensure data stability

## Important Constraints
- **Clock drift synchronization**: Maintains NTP-based clock synchronization for accurate event timestamping
- **Graceful shutdown**: Implements proper signal handling and sink flushing on termination
- **Multi-sink output**: Supports concurrent output to multiple configured data sinks with error isolation
