# Xatu Coordinator

gRPC-based coordinator implementation that connects to a remote Xatu server for dynamic peer coordination and execution node record management.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **gRPC client coordination**: Implements `CoordinateExecutionNodeRecords` via remote Xatu server for dynamic peer management
- **Scheduled sync operations**: Uses cron jobs (5-second metrics, 5-minute coordination) to maintain peer state and server synchronization
- **Peer lifecycle management**: Automatically starts/stops peers based on server coordination responses with retry delay handling

## Important Constraints
- **Concurrent peer access**: All peer map operations must be mutex-protected due to concurrent cron job access
- **gRPC compression**: Always use gzip compression for server communication to minimize bandwidth
- **Execution node status forwarding**: Must forward all execution node status events to coordinator server via handler injection
