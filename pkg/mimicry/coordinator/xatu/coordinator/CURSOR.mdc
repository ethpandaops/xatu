# Coordinator Implementation

gRPC client that communicates with remote Xatu server for execution node record coordination and status reporting.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **gRPC with compression**: Always use gzip compression for all server communication
- **Header-based authentication**: Pass configured headers via gRPC metadata for authentication
- **Fork ID hex encoding**: Convert fork ID hashes from hex strings to bytes for protobuf requests

## Important Constraints
- **TLS configuration**: Support both TLS and insecure connections based on config flag
- **Connection lifecycle**: Properly close gRPC connection during shutdown
- **Prometheus metrics**: Track node record status events with network ID and fork ID hash labels
