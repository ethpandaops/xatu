# Xatu Peer

Individual peer wrapper that manages resilient connections to Ethereum execution layer peers with automatic retry and connection state tracking.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Resilient connection lifecycle**: Wraps execution.Peer with automatic retry logic and graceful shutdown handling
- **Thread-safe state management**: Uses mutex protection for peer state (stopped, connection attempts) accessed by retry goroutines
- **Connection tracking integration**: Maintains CoordinatedNodeRecord state for parent coordinator consumption

## Important Constraints
- **Unrecoverable error pattern**: Must return retry.Unrecoverable when peer is stopped to prevent infinite retry loops
- **Mutex discipline**: All shared state access must be protected by mutex due to concurrent retry operations
- **Proper cleanup**: Always defer peer.Stop() and update connection state in retry function cleanup
