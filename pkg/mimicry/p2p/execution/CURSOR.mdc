# Execution P2P Client

Connects to individual execution layer peers via mimicry client to collect mempool transaction data.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Mimicry client wrapper**: Uses ethcore mimicry.Client to establish P2P connections with execution peers
- **Shared transaction cache**: Implements TTL cache coordination to avoid duplicate transaction processing across peers
- **Batch transaction processing**: Uses processor.BatchItemProcessor for efficient transaction hash retrieval and processing

## Important Constraints
- **Capture delay avoidance**: Implements ignoreBefore timing to skip initial transaction pool dumps from new peer connections
- **Transaction deduplication**: Must coordinate with shared cache before processing to prevent duplicate events
- **Async transaction fetching**: GetPooledTransactions calls must be handled asynchronously to avoid blocking peer communication
