# Handler Component

P2P event handling interface that defines callback functions for mimicry client interactions.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Callback interface pattern**: Defines function pointers for event handling, client metadata creation, and execution status reporting
- **Context-aware operations**: All handler functions accept context for cancellation and timeout control

## Important Constraints  
- **Interface-only design**: This component only defines the handler interface, implementations are provided by consuming packages
- **Event decoration**: Uses xatu.DecoratedEvent for structured event processing within the mimicry pipeline
