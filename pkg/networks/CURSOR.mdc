# Networks Package

Provides Ethereum network identification using chain IDs and genesis roots.

## Key Patterns
- Use predefined NetworkName constants for network identification
- Maintain NetworkGenesisRoots and NetworkIds mappings for network derivation
- Always return Network struct with both Name and ID fields populated
- Default to NetworkNameUnknown for unrecognized networks

## Network Addition Process
When adding new networks:
1. Add NetworkName constant following existing naming pattern
2. Update NetworkGenesisRoots mapping with genesis root -> chain ID
3. Update NetworkIds mapping with chain ID -> network name
4. Ensure both derivation functions support the new network
