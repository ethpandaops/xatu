# Observability Package

OpenTelemetry tracing and observability utilities for distributed monitoring across Xatu components.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **OTLP HTTP Export**: Uses OpenTelemetry HTTP exporters with configurable endpoints and retry logic
- **Context Merging**: Provides MergeContexts() to link multiple span contexts for cross-component tracing
- **SDK Lifecycle Management**: Handles proper setup and shutdown of OpenTelemetry tracer providers

## Important Constraints
- All configuration uses YAML struct tags with sensible defaults
- HTTP exporters support compression, authentication headers, and TLS configuration
- Trace sampling rate is configurable but defaults to 1% (0.01) for production safety
