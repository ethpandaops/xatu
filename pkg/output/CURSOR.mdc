# Output Package

Data output abstraction layer that supports multiple sink types (HTTP, Kafka, stdout, Xatu) with unified interface and event filtering.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use factory pattern via `NewSink()` for all sink instantiation
- Implement `Sink` interface for new output types with `Start`, `Stop`, `HandleNewDecoratedEvent` methods
- Leverage `RawMessage` for type-safe sink configuration unmarshaling
- Apply event filtering through `pxatu.EventFilterConfig` before output processing

## Critical Design Constraints
- All sinks must be stateless with context-based lifecycle management
- Configuration validation required via `Validate()` method
- Support both single and batch event handling via `HandleNewDecoratedEvent` and `HandleNewDecoratedEvents`
