# HTTP Output Sink

HTTP output sink that sends Ethereum event data to HTTP endpoints with optional compression and batch processing.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use `ItemExporter` for HTTP request execution with configurable compression strategies
- Implement batch processing via `processor.BatchItemProcessor` with configurable queue sizes and timeouts
- Support multiple compression formats (gzip, zstd, zlib, snappy) through `Compressor` abstraction

## Critical Design Constraints
- Events are serialized to NDJSON format with protojson marshaling
- HTTP client uses configurable timeouts and keep-alive settings
- All compression happens before request execution to optimize network transfer
- Filter events before batching to reduce unnecessary processing overhead
