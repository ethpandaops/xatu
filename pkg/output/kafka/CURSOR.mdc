# Kafka Output

Apache Kafka sink implementation providing high-throughput event streaming with batch processing and configurable reliability.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use IBM Sarama library for Kafka producer operations with `sarama.SyncProducer`
- Implement `BatchItemProcessor` pattern for efficient message batching
- Apply compression strategies (gzip, snappy, lz4, zstd) via `CompressionStrategy` enums
- Route events using `event.Id` as partition key for ordered processing

## Important Constraints
- TLS configuration requires both certificate and key paths when enabled
- Message size validation against `FlushBytes` to prevent oversized messages
- Required acknowledgment levels (none, leader, all) affect delivery guarantees
- Partition strategy selection impacts message distribution across Kafka partitions
