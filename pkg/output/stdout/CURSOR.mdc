# Stdout Output Sink

Standard output sink that serializes Xatu events to JSON and outputs them via configurable logging levels.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use protobuf JSON marshaling via `protojson.Marshal()` for event serialization
- Support configurable logging levels (debug, info, warn, error) with fallback to info
- Implement batch processing through inherited `ItemExporter` interface

## Important Constraints
- Events logged as structured JSON with `event` field containing serialized `DecoratedEvent`
- No actual stdout writes - uses logrus logger with configured level for output control
- Stateless design with graceful shutdown support via context cancellation
