# Xatu Output Sink

gRPC-based output sink that delivers events to upstream Xatu server with batching, retry logic, and TLS support.

## Key Integration Patterns
- Use `BatchItemProcessor` for efficient batching with configurable queue and batch sizes
- Implement exponential backoff retry with `retry.BackoffExponential` for upstream failures  
- Support both TLS and insecure gRPC connections based on configuration
- Apply gzip compression for all upstream requests to reduce bandwidth

## Critical Design Constraints
- Maintain stateless ItemExporter with connection lifecycle tied to component lifecycle
- Always include keepalive configuration for long-running gRPC connections
- Filter events before batching to avoid processing dropped events upstream
- Use structured metadata headers for authentication and request context
