# Processor Package

Generic batching processor that handles high-throughput item export with configurable worker pools and timeouts.

## Key Patterns
- Use generic `ItemExporter[T]` interface for type-safe batch export operations
- Implement configurable worker pools with `WithWorkers()` option for concurrent processing
- Support both sync and async shipping methods via `ShippingMethod` configuration
- Always include comprehensive Prometheus metrics for monitoring batch operations

## Important Constraints  
- Queue size must be >= batch size to prevent configuration errors
- Export operations must honor context timeouts and cancellation
- Sync mode blocks until all items in batch are processed or failed
- Workers drain gracefully on shutdown before closing exporter
