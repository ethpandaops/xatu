# Blockprint Protocol Definitions

Protocol buffer definitions for Ethereum consensus client classification based on block analysis.

## Key Patterns
- **Blockprint Integration**: Structures for consensus client fingerprinting and probability scoring
- **Client Detection**: Supports classification of major consensus clients (Prysm, Teku, Nimbus, Lodestar, Grandine, Lighthouse)
- **Probability Model**: Uses floating point probabilities for multi-client classification confidence

## Important Constraints
- Maintains compatibility with upstream blockprint classification service
- Uses google.protobuf.FloatValue for nullable probability scores
- JSON field names use snake_case convention for API compatibility
