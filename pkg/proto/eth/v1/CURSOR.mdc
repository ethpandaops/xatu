# Ethereum v1 Protocol Buffers

Conversion layer between Ethereum consensus client types and protocol buffer formats supporting all hard fork versions.

## Key Patterns
- Use conversion functions for bidirectional mapping between go-eth2-client types and protobuf messages
- Maintain string representations for complex types (roots, signatures, commitments) using hex encoding
- Support multiple hard fork versions (phase0, capella, deneb, electra) in conversion logic
- Always validate hex string format with proper "0x" prefix and expected length in string-to-type conversions
