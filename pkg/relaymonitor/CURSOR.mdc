# Relay Monitor Component

Monitors MEV relay infrastructure by fetching bid traces and payload delivery data using slot-based scheduling.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Slot-based Scheduling**: Use ethereum.Wallclock().OnSlotChanged() for time-sensitive operations
- **Multi-relay Support**: Each relay.Client operates independently with consistent interfaces
- **Event-driven Architecture**: All data flows through handleNewDecoratedEvent() pipeline

## Critical Constraints
- **Clock Drift Sync**: Always sync clock drift via NTP before scheduling operations
- **Duplicate Prevention**: Use bidCache.Has() before processing bid traces to prevent duplicates
- **Stateless Design**: Each relay client maintains no state between polling cycles

## Timing Requirements
- Bid traces fetch at configurable slot offsets (Schedule.AtSlotTimes)
- Payload delivery data fetched after slot completion
- All events timestamped with clock drift compensation
