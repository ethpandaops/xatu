# Ethereum Beacon Integration

Provides beacon chain connectivity and validator management for MEV relay monitoring operations.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Beacon Node Wrapper**: Use BeaconNode.Start() to establish connection with health checking and timeout handling
- **Wallclock Provider**: Always initialize ethereum wallclock via beacon chain genesis data for accurate slot timing
- **Validator Query Interface**: Use GetActiveValidators() for relay monitoring validator filtering

## Critical Constraints
- **5-minute startup timeout**: BeaconNode.Start() has hardcoded 5-minute deadline for readiness
- **Health check interval**: 3-second health checks with single successful response requirement
- **Genesis dependency**: Wallclock initialization requires successful beacon node genesis fetch
