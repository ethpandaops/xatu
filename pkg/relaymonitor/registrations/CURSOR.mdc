# Validator Registration Monitor

Monitors validator registrations across MEV relays using sharded, rate-limited crawling with configurable sweep durations.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Sharded Processing**: Use ValidatorSetWalker for deterministic validator distribution across shards
- **Rate-Limited Crawling**: Implement exponential backoff via RelayValidatorRegistrationScraper when receiving rate limits
- **Worker Pool Pattern**: Each relay gets independent workers (configured via config.Workers)

## Critical Constraints
- **Sweep Duration**: Must respect targetSweepDuration to avoid relay bans - calculate validator feed rate accordingly
- **Rate Limit Handling**: Always check relay.ErrRateLimited and back off for 30+ seconds
- **Shard Boundaries**: Validator indices must stay within shard min/max bounds during processing
