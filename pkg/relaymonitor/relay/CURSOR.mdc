# Relay Client Component

HTTP client for individual MEV relay API interactions with built-in metrics and error handling.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Standardized API Interface**: All relay endpoints use consistent HTTP patterns and protobuf response conversion
- **Metrics Integration**: Every API call automatically tracks requests, failures, response times, and data counts via prometheus
- **Context-aware Requests**: All HTTP operations use context.Context for timeout and cancellation handling

## Critical Constraints
- **Timeout Enforcement**: All HTTP clients use 10-second timeout for network resilience
- **Error Classification**: Distinguish between rate limiting (429), validation errors, and network failures
- **Protobuf Conversion**: Always convert JSON responses to standardized mevrelay protobuf types for consistency
