# Sentry Component

Beacon chain monitoring client that connects to consensus clients via Beacon API to collect real-time Ethereum network data.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Multi-client Support**: Supports multiple beacon client implementations through standardized Beacon API
- **Event-driven Architecture**: Listens to beacon chain events (blocks, attestations, voluntary exits, etc.) and processes them in real-time
- **Configurable Data Collection**: Modular event collection with granular enable/disable controls per event type

## Design Constraints  
- **Stateless Design**: Maintains minimal state, relies on beacon client for blockchain state
- **Output Sink Pattern**: All collected data flows through configured output sinks (file, HTTP, gRPC)
- **Version-aware Event Handling**: Supports multiple Ethereum specification versions (v1, v2, v3) with backward compatibility
