# Cache Component

Provides duplicate event detection using TTL-based caching to prevent reprocessing of beacon chain and execution layer events.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Event-specific TTL Caching**: Uses separate TTL caches for each event type with appropriate timeouts (7min for consensus, 30s for execution)
- **Single Cache Instance**: Centralized DuplicateCache struct manages all event type caches through unified Start() lifecycle

## Design Constraints
- **TTL-based Expiration**: Cache entries auto-expire based on event type - consensus events need longer retention due to potential epoch boundary duplicates
- **String Key Mapping**: All cache keys are strings mapped to timestamps for simple duplicate detection
