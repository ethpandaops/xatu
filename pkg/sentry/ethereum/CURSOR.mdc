# Ethereum Beacon Node Component

Beacon API client wrapper that orchestrates metadata and duties services for Ethereum beacon chain monitoring.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service Orchestration**: Manages lifecycle of metadata and duties services with dependency coordination
- **Health-aware Startup**: Waits for upstream beacon node health before initializing services
- **Subscription Configuration**: Supports custom beacon subscriptions or defaults to standard event types

## Important Constraints
- **Sequential Service Startup**: Services start only after beacon node health confirmation with 10-minute timeout
- **Service Dependencies**: Duties service depends on metadata service for network context
- **Synchronization Requirements**: All services must be ready before marking node as operational
