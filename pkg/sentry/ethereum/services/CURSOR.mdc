# Services Component

Core foundational services for Ethereum beacon chain data collection including metadata retrieval, validator duties caching, and client identification.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service Interface Pattern**: All services implement Start/Stop/Ready/OnReady lifecycle with dependency coordination
- **TTL Caching Strategy**: Use TTL caches with automatic refresh for beacon committees and proposer duties (60-minute TTL)
- **Event-driven Refresh**: Services react to wallclock epoch changes and beacon sync status for automatic data refresh

## Important Constraints
- **Exponential Backoff Required**: All beacon API calls must use backoff.RetryWithExponentialBackOff pattern
- **Thread-safe Caching**: Use mutex locks for concurrent access to cached beacon committee and proposer duty data
- **Configurable Service Enablement**: Support selective enablement of duties collection (proposerDutiesEnabled, beaconCommitteesEnabled flags)
