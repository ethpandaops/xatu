# Sentry Beacon ETH API v1 Event Handlers

Ethereum beacon chain event handler implementations for Beacon API v1 specification.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Standardized Event Processing**: All event handlers follow consistent struct pattern with beacon node, client metadata, and duplicate cache
- **Protocol Buffer Serialization**: Events are converted to protobuf format for standardized data pipeline processing
- **Deduplication Logic**: Uses TTL cache with hash-based deduplication to prevent duplicate event processing

## Design Constraints
- **API Version Specificity**: Handlers are locked to go-eth2-client v1 API types - maintain strict version alignment
- **Event-specific Validation**: Each event type has unique validation requirements based on beacon chain specification
- **Memory Efficiency**: Duplicate cache and event processing must handle high-throughput beacon chain events
