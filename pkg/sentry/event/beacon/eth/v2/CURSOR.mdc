# Beacon Eth V2 Events

Processes Ethereum Beacon Chain v2 block events with fork-specific handling and network monitoring enrichment.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Fork-Aware Processing**: Handles multiple Ethereum consensus specification versions (Phase0, Altair, Bellatrix, Capella, Deneb, Electra) with version-specific transaction extraction
- **Event Decoration Pattern**: Enriches beacon block events with computed metadata (slot timing, transaction counts, compression metrics)
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses TTL cache with content hashing to prevent reprocessing of identical block events

## Important Constraints
- **Time-Based Filtering**: Automatically ignores blocks older than 16 slots from current slot
- **Beacon Sync Dependency**: Requires beacon node synchronization before processing events
- **SSZ Serialization**: Uses SSZ marshaling for block size calculations and compression metrics
