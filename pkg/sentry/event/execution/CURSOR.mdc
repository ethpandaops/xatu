# Execution Event Processing

Mempool transaction event processing component that transforms Ethereum execution layer transactions into structured events.

## Key Patterns
- **Duplicate Detection**: Uses TTL cache with composite keys (hash:nonce:to_address) to prevent duplicate transaction processing
- **Fallback Address Resolution**: Prioritizes pre-populated sender addresses from txpool_content, falls back to signature recovery
- **Blob Transaction Support**: Handles EIP-4844 blob transactions with sidecar data processing and size metrics

## Design Constraints
- **Signer Dependency**: Requires configured transaction signer for sender address recovery when pre-populated data unavailable
- **Cache-based Deduplication**: Relies on TTL cache for duplicate transaction filtering with configurable expiration
