# Execution Component

Mempool monitoring client that collects pending transactions from Ethereum execution clients via multiple discovery methods.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Unified Client Interface**: Supports multiple execution clients (Geth, Besu, Nethermind, Erigon) through `ClientProvider` interface
- **Triple Discovery Strategy**: Combines WebSocket subscriptions, txpool_content polling, and eth_pendingTransactions for comprehensive coverage
- **Circuit Breaker Protection**: All RPC operations wrapped in circuit breakers to handle client failures gracefully

## Critical Design Constraints
- **Deduplication Required**: Same transactions discovered via multiple sources must be deduplicated using hash-based tracking
- **Batch Processing**: Transaction details fetched in configurable batches to avoid overwhelming execution clients
- **Stateful Transaction Tracking**: Maintains temporary `pendingTxs` map for processing coordination, not permanent mempool state
