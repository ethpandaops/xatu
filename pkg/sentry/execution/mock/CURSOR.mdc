# Mock Component

Auto-generated mock implementation of the execution ClientProvider interface for testing purposes.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **GoMock Framework**: Uses go.uber.org/mock/gomock for generating interface test doubles
- **ClientProvider Interface**: Mocks all execution client operations (pending txs, batch fetching, subscriptions)

## Critical Constraints
- **Generated Code**: File is auto-generated and should NEVER be manually edited
- **Regeneration Required**: Changes to parent ClientProvider interface require regenerating mocks via `mockgen` command
