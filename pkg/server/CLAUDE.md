# Server Package Guidelines

The server package implements the Xatu server component, which acts as the central hub collecting events from various clients and distributing them to output sinks.

## Server Component
Claude MUST read the `.cursor/rules/server.mdc` file before making any changes here.

## Event Handling
Claude MUST read the `.cursor/rules/event_handling.mdc` file before making any changes to event-related code.
