# Server Component Rules

Centralized gRPC server that collects events from distributed Xatu clients and routes data to configured output sinks.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Service-Based Architecture**: Manages multiple gRPC services (event-ingester, coordinator) via common interface
- **Multi-Store Support**: Abstracts persistence (database) and caching (memory/redis) via provider pattern
- **Optional Components**: All major features (persistence, geoip, tracing) are configurable and can be disabled

## Critical Design Constraints
- **Graceful Lifecycle Management**: All components must implement Start/Stop methods for coordinated shutdown
- **Health Check Integration**: Use grpc health service to report component status during startup/shutdown
- **Override Support**: Configuration can be dynamically overridden at runtime (especially for auth)
