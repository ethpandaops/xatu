# GeoIP Component Rules

IP geolocation service that supports multiple providers via adapter pattern for enriching network data with geographic information.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Provider Interface**: All geoip providers must implement the Provider interface (Start/Stop, LookupIP)
- **Factory Pattern**: NewProvider function creates providers based on type with unified configuration approach
- **Optional Service**: Designed to be safely disabled when geoip.enabled=false

## Important Constraints  
- **Context-Aware Operations**: All LookupIP calls must include context for cancellation/timeout
- **Lifecycle Management**: Providers must support Start/Stop for resource management (database connections, etc.)
- **RawMessage Config**: Use RawMessage pattern for type-specific configuration unmarshaling
