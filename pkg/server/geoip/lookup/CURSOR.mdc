# Lookup Component Rules

Standardized data structure for geoip lookup results returned by all geoip providers.

## Key Integration Pattern
- **Shared Data Contract**: Result struct defines the common fields that all geoip providers must populate
- **Provider Agnostic**: Structure is independent of specific geoip provider implementation details

## Important Constraints
- **Immutable Structure**: Changes to Result struct fields affect all geoip providers and consumers
- **Consistent Field Types**: Use standard Go types that marshal/unmarshal reliably across providers
