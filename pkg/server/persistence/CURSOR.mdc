# Persistence Component Rules

Database abstraction layer that manages connections and provides conflict resolution for Xatu server data persistence.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **SQL Builder Pattern**: Uses huandu/go-sqlbuilder for type-safe PostgreSQL query construction
- **Conflict Resolution**: Implements upsert operations with ON CONFLICT clauses for idempotent data insertion
- **Struct-Based ORM**: Maps Go structs to database tables using sqlbuilder reflection

## Critical Design Constraints
- **Connection Pooling**: Always configure MaxIdleConns and MaxOpenConns for database performance
- **Context-Aware Operations**: All database operations must accept and propagate context for cancellation
- **Idempotent Operations**: Use upsert patterns with conflict resolution rather than insert-only operations
