# Server Service Layer Rules

Service factory that instantiates and manages gRPC services (event-ingester, coordinator) with shared dependencies.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **GRPCService Interface**: All services implement Start/Stop lifecycle and Name() for uniform management
- **Factory Pattern**: CreateGRPCServices() instantiates enabled services with shared dependencies (persistence, geoip, cache)
- **Conditional Instantiation**: Services are only created when explicitly enabled in configuration

## Important Constraints
- **Service Interface Compliance**: All created services must implement the GRPCService interface with proper lifecycle methods
- **Shared Dependency Injection**: Pass common dependencies (logger, health server, cache, persistence) to all service constructors
- **Configuration Validation**: Both service-level and package-level validation must pass before instantiation
