# Coordinator Service Rules

Node record management and client coordination service for Ethereum P2P network discovery and execution node monitoring.

## Primary Purpose
Manages Ethereum node discovery coordination by tracking node records, facilitating client connections, and providing execution node status updates with optional geoIP enrichment.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Multi-Client Coordination**: Distributes available node records across multiple discovery clients to prevent overlap
- **Node Record Lifecycle**: Tracks connection attempts, success rates, and stalled nodes with automatic retry logic
- **gRPC Service Implementation**: Implements multiple coordinator endpoints (CreateNodeRecords, CoordinateExecutionNodeRecords, ListStalledExecutionNodeRecords)

## Important Constraints
- **Authentication Integration**: All endpoints validate bearer token auth when enabled via metadata extraction
- **Rate Limiting**: Connection attempts are limited (max 100 per node) and client coordination respects request limits (max 1000 records)
- **Persistence Dependency**: Requires persistence client for all database operations (node records, activities, executions)
