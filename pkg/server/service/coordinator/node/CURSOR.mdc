# Node Record Processing Rules

Batched processing and persistence of Ethereum node records with configurable queueing and timeout handling.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Batch Item Processor**: Uses processor.BatchItemProcessor for async batch processing with configurable parameters
- **Exporter Pattern**: RecordExporter implements processor.Exporter interface for database persistence operations
- **Graceful Lifecycle**: Start/Stop methods coordinate processor lifecycle with proper shutdown handling

## Important Constraints
- **Error Isolation**: Write errors are logged but don't block processing - persistence failures don't propagate back to coordinator
- **Configurable Batching**: All timing parameters (batch timeout, export timeout, queue size) are externally configurable
- **Async Shipping**: Uses ShippingMethodAsync for non-blocking writes to maintain coordinator responsiveness
