# Event Ingester Service Rules

gRPC service that ingests Ethereum network events from distributed clients with authorization, filtering, and routing to configured output sinks.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Authorization Pipeline**: Implements user/group-based access control with token validation and event filtering
- **Event Router Pattern**: Routes events through type-specific handlers for validation and enrichment before sink delivery
- **Dual Redaction Strategy**: Events are redacted before AND after processing to prevent data leakage during geoip/enrichment

## Important Constraints
- **Authorization Required**: When enabled, all requests must include valid authorization headers
- **Event Validation**: All events must pass handler-specific validation before routing to output sinks
- **GeoIP Enrichment**: Client IP addresses are enriched with geographical data when geoip provider is available
- **OpenTelemetry Integration**: All operations include proper span creation with error status reporting
