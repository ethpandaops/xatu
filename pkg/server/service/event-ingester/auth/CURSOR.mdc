# Event Ingester Auth Rules

Authentication and authorization middleware that validates client tokens, filters events per user/group permissions, and redacts sensitive data fields.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Group-Based Permission Model**: Users belong to groups; group filters override user filters for broader access
- **Filter-Then-Redact Pipeline**: User filters → Group filters → Group redaction for optimal performance
- **Client Name Obscuring**: Configurable hashing with TTL cache for anonymous client identification

## Critical Design Constraints
- **No Cross-Group Users**: Users cannot exist in multiple groups (validated at startup)
- **Basic Auth Only**: Currently supports only basic authentication with base64 encoding
- **Immutable Filter Order**: User filtering is always more restrictive than group filtering
