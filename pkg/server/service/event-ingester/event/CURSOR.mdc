# Event Router Rules

Type-safe routing system that dispatches incoming Ethereum network events to versioned handlers with validation and enrichment.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Router Registration Pattern**: All event types must register handlers via RegisterHandler() during router initialization
- **Versioned Event Support**: Supports multiple API versions (v1, v2, v3) of the same event type with separate handlers
- **Event Interface Contract**: All handlers implement Event interface with Type(), Validate(), Filter(), and AppendServerMeta() methods

## Important Constraints
- **Handler Registration Required**: Every supported event type must have a registered handler or routing will fail
- **Type Safety**: Event routing is strictly typed using const Type definitions to prevent runtime errors
- **Domain Segregation**: Events are organized by domain (beacon, libp2p, mempool, mevrelay) with separate handler packages
