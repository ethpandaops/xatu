# Beacon ETH V1 Event Handlers

Handles versioned Ethereum Beacon API v1 event types with standardized validation, filtering, and metadata enrichment.

## Key Patterns
- **Event Handler Interface**: All handlers implement Type(), Validate(), Filter(), and AppendServerMeta() methods for consistent processing
- **Proto Type Casting**: Each handler validates event data through explicit casting to expected proto message types
- **Version Evolution**: Supports both v1 and v2 variants of event types to handle API evolution without breaking compatibility

## Implementation Requirements
- **Type Safety**: Always cast event data to expected proto type in Validate() method with proper error handling
- **Consistent Logging**: Use structured logging with event type field for debugging and monitoring
- **Stateless Design**: All methods must be context-based with no persistent state between calls
