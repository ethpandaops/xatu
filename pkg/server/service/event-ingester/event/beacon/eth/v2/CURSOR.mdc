# ETH V2 Event Handlers Rules

Ethereum beacon chain v2 API event handlers that process beacon blocks and sub-block components with finalization state tracking.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Finalization Cache Pattern**: Non-finalized blocks use cache to prevent duplicate processing; finalized blocks bypass cache
- **Sub-Block Component Handlers**: Each beacon block element (deposits, attestations, slashings, etc.) has dedicated handler
- **Type Constant Pattern**: All handlers define const Type strings following "BEACON_API_ETH_V2_BEACON_BLOCK_*" format

## Important Constraints
- **Cache Strategy**: Only non-finalized blocks require cache lookup to prevent duplicate forwarding
- **Event Data Casting**: All handlers must validate DecoratedEvent casting in Validate() method before processing
- **V2 API Compliance**: Handlers process eth/v2 beacon API data structures from attestantio/go-eth2-client
