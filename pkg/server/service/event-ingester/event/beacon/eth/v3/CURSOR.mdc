# ETH V3 Event Handlers Rules

Ethereum beacon chain v3 API event handlers that process validator blocks across multiple consensus protocol versions.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Multi-Fork Support Pattern**: Handlers switch on version field to process different consensus forks (phase0, altair, bellatrix, capella, deneb, electra)
- **State Root Extraction**: Extract state roots from version-specific block structures for filtering decisions
- **Type Constant Pattern**: All handlers define const Type strings following "BEACON_API_ETH_V3_*" format

## Important Constraints
- **Version Validation Required**: All handlers must validate version field from client additional data before processing
- **Fork-Specific Casting**: Type assertions must handle all supported consensus forks with appropriate error handling
- **V3 API Compliance**: Handlers process eth/v3 validator block API data structures with version-specific message types
