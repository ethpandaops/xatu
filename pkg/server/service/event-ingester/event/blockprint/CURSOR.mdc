# Blockprint Event Handler

Handles Blockprint block classification events within the event ingestion pipeline.

## Key Patterns
- **Event Handler Interface**: Must implement Type(), Validate(), Filter(), and AppendServerMeta() methods
- **Type Constant**: Use BlockClassificationType constant for event identification
- **Data Validation**: Cast event data to *xatu.DecoratedEvent_BlockprintBlockClassification in Validate()
- **No Enrichment**: AppendServerMeta() returns meta unchanged - no server-side enrichment
