# LibP2P Event Handlers

Processes libp2p network tracing events from Ethereum P2P layer with automatic peer geo-enrichment.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Trace Event Pattern**: All handlers follow `TraceX{Type}` naming with corresponding `NewTraceX{Type}` constructor
- **Type Registration**: Each handler defines a Type constant from `xatu.Event_LIBP2P_TRACE_{TYPE}.String()`
- **Selective GeoIP Enrichment**: Only connection-related events (connected/disconnected) include geoip lookups for peer IPs

## Important Constraints
- **Multiaddr Parsing**: Extract IP addresses from libp2p multiaddr format (/protocol/ip/port) for geoip lookups
- **Error Resilience**: GeoIP failures should log warnings but never block event processing
- **Standard Interface**: All handlers must implement Event interface (Type, Validate, Filter, AppendServerMeta)
