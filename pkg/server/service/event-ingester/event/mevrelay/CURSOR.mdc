# MEV Relay Event Handlers

MEV relay event handlers for bid traces, payload deliveries, and validator registrations with domain-specific validation.

## Key Integration Patterns
- **Uniform Event Interface**: All handlers implement Type(), Validate(), Filter(), and AppendServerMeta() methods
- **Type-Safe Event Casting**: Each handler validates and casts DecoratedEvent data to the correct MEV relay event type
- **Domain-Specific Validation**: Validator registration requires non-empty pubkey validation beyond basic type checking

## Important Constraints
- **No Filtering**: All MEV relay events return false from Filter() method (events are never filtered out)
- **Type Constants**: Use predefined xatu.Event enum constants for event type definitions
- **Structured Logging**: Include event type in logger field for consistent log correlation
