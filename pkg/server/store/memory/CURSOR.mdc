# Memory Cache Component Rules

In-memory cache implementation using ttlcache library with comprehensive Prometheus metrics tracking.

## Key Implementation Patterns
- **TTL Cache Integration**: Uses `jellydator/ttlcache/v3` as the underlying storage engine with automatic expiration
- **Operation Metrics**: Tracks all cache operations (get/set/delete) with hit/miss status via Prometheus counters
- **Zero Configuration**: Requires no external dependencies or configuration - ready to use out of the box

## Critical Design Decisions
- **Ephemeral Storage**: Data is lost on process restart - suitable only for temporary caching needs
- **Automatic Metrics Registration**: Prometheus metrics are registered globally during initialization
- **Context Awareness**: All operations accept context for cancellation but don't currently use it
