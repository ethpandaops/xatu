# Horizon Progress Log

Branch: ralph/horizon
Started: 2026-01-21

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `buf generate --path <file>` when symlinks cause issues with full buf generate
- HorizonType enum values follow pattern HORIZON_TYPE_<API_PATH> (e.g., HORIZON_TYPE_BEACON_API_ETH_V2_BEACON_BLOCK)
- HorizonLocation uses simpler slot-based tracking (head_slot, fill_slot) vs Cannon's epoch-based BackfillingCheckpointMarker
- Persistence layer pattern: create `pkg/server/persistence/<module>/location.go` for struct with Marshal/Unmarshal, then `pkg/server/persistence/<module>_location.go` for client methods
- PostgreSQL migrations go in `migrations/postgres/` with sequential numbering (e.g., 009_horizon.up.sql)
- Use `sqlbuilder.Raw("DEFAULT")` for auto-increment ID fields when inserting
- ON CONFLICT constraint names follow pattern `<table>_unique`
- Shared interfaces between Cannon/Horizon go in pkg/cldata/ with subdirectories for deriver/ and iterator/
- EventDeriver interface uses CannonType() method even for shared code (Horizon will map HorizonType to equivalent CannonType)
- Iterator interface uses Position struct with both Slot and Epoch fields to support both slot-based (Horizon) and epoch-based (Cannon) processing
- Use adapter pattern to bridge module-specific types to shared interfaces (e.g., IteratorAdapter, BeaconClientAdapter, ContextProviderAdapter in v2/adapters.go)
- Position.LookAheadEpochs (not LookAheads) for epoch-based preloading to avoid type confusion
- Shared helper functions like GetBlockIdentifier, ConvertIndexedAttestation go in pkg/cldata/deriver/ and are exported for reuse
- When extending shared interfaces (BeaconClient, ContextProvider), update ALL adapters that implement them
- Blob utility functions live in pkg/cldata/blob.go (ConvertKzgCommitmentToVersionedHash, CountConsecutiveEmptyBytes)
- BeaconClient duties methods: FetchBeaconCommittee(epoch) for committee info, GetValidatorIndex(epoch, slot, committeeIndex, position) for validator lookups
- Large parameter types (like 96-byte BLSSignature) should be passed by pointer to avoid copy overhead

## 2026-01-21 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Added HorizonType enum to coordinator.proto mirroring CannonType (13 deriver types)
  - Added HorizonLocation message with network_id, type, head_slot, fill_slot fields
  - Added GetHorizonLocation and UpsertHorizonLocation RPC methods to Coordinator service
  - Generated Go code with buf generate --path
- Files changed:
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.proto (added enum, messages, RPC methods)
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.pb.go (regenerated)
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator_grpc.pb.go (regenerated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Symlinks in project root (.cursor, .roo, ai_docs, llms) cause buf generate to fail with "EvalSymlinks: too many links"
  - Use `buf generate --path pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.proto` to work around this
  - HorizonLocation tracks dual progress (HEAD real-time + FILL catch-up) unlike Cannon's single backfill marker
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created PostgreSQL migration for horizon_location table (009_horizon.up.sql, 009_horizon.down.sql)
  - Created pkg/server/persistence/horizon/location.go with Location struct and Marshal/Unmarshal methods
  - Created pkg/server/persistence/horizon_location.go with UpsertHorizonLocation and GetHorizonLocationByNetworkIDAndType methods
  - Implemented GetHorizonLocation RPC handler in coordinator client
  - Implemented UpsertHorizonLocation RPC handler in coordinator client
- Files changed:
  - migrations/postgres/009_horizon.up.sql (new - creates horizon_location table)
  - migrations/postgres/009_horizon.down.sql (new - drops horizon_location table)
  - pkg/server/persistence/horizon/location.go (new - Location struct with Marshal/Unmarshal)
  - pkg/server/persistence/horizon_location.go (new - persistence client methods)
  - pkg/server/service/coordinator/client.go (added GetHorizonLocation and UpsertHorizonLocation handlers)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HorizonLocation is simpler than CannonLocation - stores head_slot and fill_slot directly without oneof Data pattern
  - Follow existing patterns: cannon/location.go and relaymonitor/location.go for struct design
  - Coordinator RPC handlers follow consistent auth check pattern at start of each method
  - Use ErrHorizonLocationNotFound sentinel error for "not found" cases (don't return nil error with nil result)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created pkg/cldata/ directory structure with deriver/ and iterator/ subdirectories
  - Created pkg/cldata/deriver/interface.go with EventDeriver interface (Start, Stop, Name, CannonType, OnEventsDerived, ActivationFork)
  - Created pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go with Iterator interface (Start, Next, UpdateLocation) and Position struct
  - Created pkg/cldata/context.go with ContextProvider interface (CreateClientMeta, NetworkName, NetworkID, Wallclock)
- Files changed:
  - pkg/cldata/context.go (new - ContextProvider interface)
  - pkg/cldata/deriver/interface.go (new - EventDeriver interface)
  - pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go (new - Iterator interface, Position struct, Direction type, ErrLocationUpToDate)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cannon's EventDeriver interface in pkg/cannon/deriver/event_deriver.go served as the template
  - Cannon's BackfillingCheckpoint iterator returns epoch-based positions; Horizon will use slot-based
  - Position struct includes both Slot and Epoch to support both processing modes
  - Direction type uses "forward"/"backward" instead of "head"/"backfill" for clearer semantics
  - ContextProvider abstracts network metadata needed by derivers (CreateClientMeta is key for event decoration)

## 2026-01-21 - US-004
- What was implemented:
  - Created pkg/cldata/beacon.go with BeaconClient interface for block fetching (GetBeaconBlock, LazyLoadBeaconBlock, Synced, Node)
  - Created shared BeaconBlockDeriver in pkg/cldata/deriver/beacon_block.go using Iterator, BeaconClient, and ContextProvider interfaces
  - Created adapters in pkg/cannon/deriver/beacon/eth/v2/adapters.go:
    - BeaconClientAdapter wraps *ethereum.BeaconNode to implement cldata.BeaconClient
    - IteratorAdapter wraps *iterator.BackfillingCheckpoint to implement cldata/iterator.Iterator
    - ContextProviderAdapter wraps client metadata to implement cldata.ContextProvider
  - Updated pkg/cannon/cannon.go to use shared BeaconBlockDeriver with adapters
  - Updated pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go: renamed LookAheads to LookAheadEpochs for clarity
  - Added interface verification in pkg/cannon/deriver/event_deriver.go for shared BeaconBlockDeriver
- Files changed:
  - pkg/cldata/beacon.go (new - BeaconClient interface)
  - pkg/cldata/deriver/beacon_block.go (new - shared BeaconBlockDeriver implementation)
  - pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go (updated - renamed LookAheads to LookAheadEpochs)
  - pkg/cannon/deriver/beacon/eth/v2/adapters.go (new - adapter implementations)
  - pkg/cannon/cannon.go (updated - use shared deriver with adapters)
  - pkg/cannon/deriver/event_deriver.go (updated - added interface check for shared deriver)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adapter pattern is key for bridging module-specific types (BackfillingCheckpoint, BeaconNode) to shared interfaces
  - Direction enum conversion needed: BackfillingCheckpointDirectionBackfill -> DirectionBackward, DirectionHead -> DirectionForward
  - Keep Cannon's BeaconBlockDeriverConfig with Iterator field - the shared deriver's config is simpler (just Enabled)
  - ContextProviderAdapter receives pre-built clientMeta since Cannon creates it once at startup, not per-call
  - Import shadowing: avoid naming parameters same as imported packages (e.g., `beacon` parameter shadows `beacon` package)

  - ConvertIndexedAttestation is exported (capital C) since it may be needed by other slashing-related derivers
  - Shared derivers use `ctx.CreateClientMeta(ctx)` for per-call metadata vs Cannon's pre-built clientMeta
  - Use `_ context.Context` for unused context parameters to silence linter warnings
  - Follow the established adapter wiring pattern: NewIteratorAdapter(iter), NewBeaconClientAdapter(beacon), NewContextProviderAdapter(...)
