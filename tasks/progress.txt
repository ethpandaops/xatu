# Horizon Progress Log

Branch: ralph/horizon
Started: 2026-01-21

## Codebase Patterns
- Use `buf generate --path <file>` when symlinks cause issues with full buf generate
- HorizonType enum values follow pattern HORIZON_TYPE_<API_PATH> (e.g., HORIZON_TYPE_BEACON_API_ETH_V2_BEACON_BLOCK)
- HorizonLocation uses simpler slot-based tracking (head_slot, fill_slot) vs Cannon's epoch-based BackfillingCheckpointMarker
- Persistence layer pattern: create `pkg/server/persistence/<module>/location.go` for struct with Marshal/Unmarshal, then `pkg/server/persistence/<module>_location.go` for client methods
- PostgreSQL migrations go in `migrations/postgres/` with sequential numbering (e.g., 009_horizon.up.sql)
- Use `sqlbuilder.Raw("DEFAULT")` for auto-increment ID fields when inserting
- ON CONFLICT constraint names follow pattern `<table>_unique`
- Shared interfaces between Cannon/Horizon go in pkg/cldata/ with subdirectories for deriver/ and iterator/
- EventDeriver interface uses CannonType() method even for shared code (Horizon will map HorizonType to equivalent CannonType)
- Iterator interface uses Position struct with both Slot and Epoch fields to support both slot-based (Horizon) and epoch-based (Cannon) processing
- Use adapter pattern to bridge module-specific types to shared interfaces (e.g., IteratorAdapter, BeaconClientAdapter, ContextProviderAdapter in v2/adapters.go)
- Position.LookAheadEpochs (not LookAheads) for epoch-based preloading to avoid type confusion
- Shared helper functions like GetBlockIdentifier, ConvertIndexedAttestation go in pkg/cldata/deriver/ and are exported for reuse
- When extending shared interfaces (BeaconClient, ContextProvider), update ALL adapters that implement them
- Blob utility functions live in pkg/cldata/blob.go (ConvertKzgCommitmentToVersionedHash, CountConsecutiveEmptyBytes)
- BeaconClient duties methods: FetchBeaconCommittee(epoch) for committee info, GetValidatorIndex(epoch, slot, committeeIndex, position) for validator lookups
- Large parameter types (like 96-byte BLSSignature) should be passed by pointer to avoid copy overhead

## 2026-01-21 - US-001
- What was implemented:
  - Added HorizonType enum to coordinator.proto mirroring CannonType (13 deriver types)
  - Added HorizonLocation message with network_id, type, head_slot, fill_slot fields
  - Added GetHorizonLocation and UpsertHorizonLocation RPC methods to Coordinator service
  - Generated Go code with buf generate --path
- Files changed:
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.proto (added enum, messages, RPC methods)
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.pb.go (regenerated)
  - pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator_grpc.pb.go (regenerated)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Symlinks in project root (.cursor, .roo, ai_docs, llms) cause buf generate to fail with "EvalSymlinks: too many links"
  - Use `buf generate --path pkg/proto/xatu/coordinator.proto` to work around this
  - HorizonLocation tracks dual progress (HEAD real-time + FILL catch-up) unlike Cannon's single backfill marker
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-002
- What was implemented:
  - Created PostgreSQL migration for horizon_location table (009_horizon.up.sql, 009_horizon.down.sql)
  - Created pkg/server/persistence/horizon/location.go with Location struct and Marshal/Unmarshal methods
  - Created pkg/server/persistence/horizon_location.go with UpsertHorizonLocation and GetHorizonLocationByNetworkIDAndType methods
  - Implemented GetHorizonLocation RPC handler in coordinator client
  - Implemented UpsertHorizonLocation RPC handler in coordinator client
- Files changed:
  - migrations/postgres/009_horizon.up.sql (new - creates horizon_location table)
  - migrations/postgres/009_horizon.down.sql (new - drops horizon_location table)
  - pkg/server/persistence/horizon/location.go (new - Location struct with Marshal/Unmarshal)
  - pkg/server/persistence/horizon_location.go (new - persistence client methods)
  - pkg/server/service/coordinator/client.go (added GetHorizonLocation and UpsertHorizonLocation handlers)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - HorizonLocation is simpler than CannonLocation - stores head_slot and fill_slot directly without oneof Data pattern
  - Follow existing patterns: cannon/location.go and relaymonitor/location.go for struct design
  - Coordinator RPC handlers follow consistent auth check pattern at start of each method
  - Use ErrHorizonLocationNotFound sentinel error for "not found" cases (don't return nil error with nil result)
---

## 2026-01-21 - US-003
- What was implemented:
  - Created pkg/cldata/ directory structure with deriver/ and iterator/ subdirectories
  - Created pkg/cldata/deriver/interface.go with EventDeriver interface (Start, Stop, Name, CannonType, OnEventsDerived, ActivationFork)
  - Created pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go with Iterator interface (Start, Next, UpdateLocation) and Position struct
  - Created pkg/cldata/context.go with ContextProvider interface (CreateClientMeta, NetworkName, NetworkID, Wallclock)
- Files changed:
  - pkg/cldata/context.go (new - ContextProvider interface)
  - pkg/cldata/deriver/interface.go (new - EventDeriver interface)
  - pkg/cldata/iterator/interface.go (new - Iterator interface, Position struct, Direction type, ErrLocationUpToDate)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Cannon's EventDeriver interface in pkg/cannon/deriver/event_deriver.go served as the template
  - Cannon's BackfillingCheckpoint iterator returns epoch-based positions; Horizon will use slot-based
  - Position struct includes both Slot and Epoch to support both processing modes
  - Direction type uses "forward"/"backward" instead of "head"/"backfill" for clearer semantics
  - ContextProvider abstracts network metadata needed by derivers (CreateClientMeta is key for event decoration)

## 2026-01-21 - US-004
- What was implemented:

  - Created shared BeaconBlockDeriver in pkg/cldata/deriver/beacon_block.go using Iterator, BeaconClient, and ContextProvider interfaces
  - Created adapters in pkg/cannon/deriver/beacon/eth/v2/adapters.go:
    - BeaconClientAdapter wraps *ethereum.BeaconNode to implement cldata.BeaconClient
    - IteratorAdapter wraps *iterator.BackfillingCheckpoint to implement cldata/iterator.Iterator
    - ContextProviderAdapter wraps client metadata to implement cldata.ContextProvider
  - Updated pkg/cannon/cannon.go to use shared BeaconBlockDeriver with adapters

- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Adapter pattern is key for bridging module-specific types (BackfillingCheckpoint, BeaconNode) to shared interfaces
  - Direction enum conversion needed: BackfillingCheckpointDirectionBackfill -> DirectionBackward, DirectionHead -> DirectionForward
  - Keep Cannon's BeaconBlockDeriverConfig with Iterator field - the shared deriver's config is simpler (just Enabled)
  - ContextProviderAdapter receives pre-built clientMeta since Cannon creates it once at startup, not per-call
  - Import shadowing: avoid naming parameters same as imported packages (e.g., `beacon` parameter shadows `beacon` package)

  - ConvertIndexedAttestation is exported (capital C) since it may be needed by other slashing-related derivers
  - Shared derivers use `ctx.CreateClientMeta(ctx)` for per-call metadata vs Cannon's pre-built clientMeta
  - Use `_ context.Context` for unused context parameters to silence linter warnings
  - Follow the established adapter wiring pattern: NewIteratorAdapter(iter), NewBeaconClientAdapter(beacon), NewContextProviderAdapter(...)

  - Created pkg/horizon/ethereum/ directory with three files: beacon.go, config.go, metrics.go
  - BeaconNodeConfig struct holds name, address, headers for a single beacon node
  - Config struct holds array of BeaconNodeConfig plus pool-level settings (health check interval, cache settings)
  - BeaconNodePool manages multiple beacon nodes with health checking and failover
  - BeaconNodeWrapper wraps individual nodes with health status tracking
  - Health checks run periodically using sync state from ethpandaops/beacon library
  - Shared services (MetadataService, DutiesService) initialized from first healthy node
  - Block cache shared across all nodes with singleflight for deduplication
  - Metrics: beacon_node_status (gaugevec), blocks_fetched_total, block_cache_hits/misses, block_fetch_errors, health_check_total, health_check_duration
  - Updated Horizon config.go to include Ethereum configuration
  - Updated overrides.go with BeaconNodeURLs, BeaconNodeHeaders, NetworkName overrides
- Files changed:
  - pkg/horizon/ethereum/beacon.go (new - BeaconNodePool with health checking, block caching)
  - pkg/horizon/ethereum/config.go (new - BeaconNodeConfig, Config structs)
  - pkg/horizon/ethereum/metrics.go (new - Metrics struct with beacon node status tracking)
  - pkg/horizon/config.go (updated - added Ethereum config field, validation)
  - pkg/horizon/overrides.go (updated - added beacon node override support)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - BeaconNodePool reuses cannon/ethereum/services (MetadataService, DutiesService) for consistency
  - Health checking uses beacon.Node.Status().SyncState().SyncDistance to determine health
  - Use singleflight.Group to prevent duplicate block fetches across concurrent requests
  - SetBeaconNodeStatus sets gauge to 1 for active status, 0 for others (multi-status pattern)
  - services.NewMetadataService returns value, take address for pointer: `metadata := services.NewMetadataService(...); p.metadata = &metadata`
  - Use goroutine parameter capture pattern: `go func(w *Wrapper) { ... }(wrapper)` for clarity
  - For loop uint64 conversion: use `for i := uint64(0); i < config.Workers; i++` not `int(config.Workers)`

## 2026-01-21 - US-021
- What was implemented:
  - Added exponential backoff retry logic for beacon node connections using cenkalti/backoff/v5
  - Added startNodeWithRetry method that retries failed connections with exponential backoff (1s initial, 30s max interval)
  - Added PreferNode(nodeAddress) method that prefers a specific node but falls back to any healthy node
  - Added NodeState enum (Disconnected, Connecting, Connected, Reconnecting) for connection state tracking
  - Added GetState() and Address() helper methods to BeaconNodeWrapper
  - Updated Start() to use startNodeWithRetry for all beacon nodes
- Files changed:
  - pkg/horizon/ethereum/beacon.go (updated - added retry logic, PreferNode, NodeState enum)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - cenkalti/backoff/v5 API: use backoff.Retry(ctx, operation, retryOpts...) with backoff.WithBackOff(bo) and backoff.WithNotify(fn)
  - backoff v5 does not have MaxElapsedTime field; just set InitialInterval and MaxInterval on ExponentialBackOff
  - Use backoff.Permanent(err) to stop retrying on fatal errors (context cancellation, shutdown)
  - The ethpandaops/beacon library handles its own internal reconnection, so we only need retry at the initial Start() level

## 2026-01-21 - US-022
- What was implemented:
  - Created pkg/horizon/subscription/block.go with BlockSubscription struct
  - BlockEvent struct contains Slot, BlockRoot, ExecutionOptimistic, ReceivedAt, NodeName fields
  - Uses ethpandaops/beacon library's OnBlock callback to receive SSE block events
  - Library handles SSE connection management, reconnection with backoff, and payload parsing
  - Events emitted to buffered channel (configurable buffer size, default 1000)
  - Metrics: sse_events_total, sse_connection_status, sse_reconnects_total, sse_last_event_received_at, sse_event_processing_delay_seconds
  - Config struct with BufferSize field and validation
- Files changed:
  - pkg/horizon/subscription/block.go (new - BlockSubscription with SSE event handling and metrics)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - The ethpandaops/beacon library provides OnBlock, OnHead, OnAttestation, etc. callbacks for SSE events
  - SSE connection management (reconnection, backoff) is handled internally by the beacon library
  - Use non-blocking channel send with default case to avoid blocking on full channels
  - Track processing delay by comparing receivedAt with slot start time from Wallclock
  - Sentry module uses similar pattern with beacon.Node().OnBlock() for SSE subscriptions

## 2026-01-21 - US-023
- What was implemented:
  - Created pkg/horizon/cache/dedup.go with DedupCache struct for block event deduplication
  - Uses jellydator/ttlcache/v3 library (same pattern as sentry, relaymonitor, mimicry caches)
  - DedupCache has configurable TTL (default 13 minutes to cover ~1 epoch plus delays)
  - Check(blockRoot) returns true if seen (duplicate), false if new (first occurrence)
  - On first occurrence, block root is automatically added to cache with TTL
  - Config struct with TTL field and Validate method (sets default if TTL <= 0)
  - Metrics struct with dedup_hits_total, dedup_misses_total, dedup_cache_size
  - Start() and Stop() methods for cache cleanup goroutine lifecycle
- Files changed:
  - pkg/horizon/cache/dedup.go (new - DedupCache with TTL-based block root deduplication and metrics)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Use jellydator/ttlcache/v3 for TTL-based caching (consistent with codebase pattern)
  - Cache.Start() runs cleanup goroutine, call in `go cache.Start()` pattern
  - TTL of 13 minutes covers slightly more than 1 epoch (6.4 min) to handle delayed events
  - Metrics pattern: hits_total (duplicates dropped), misses_total (new items processed), cache_size (current entries)
  - Check() combines get and set atomically - if not present, add; return whether was present
